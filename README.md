# REST-API
Node.js and Express framework

Handle GET and POST Request 

Express framework provides *router()* method to create HTTP endpoints.

Express requires an additional middleware module to extract incoming data of a POST request. This middleware is called as ‘body-parser’. 


*sudo npm install --save body-parser*

 I've imported this package in my project and now Express will use it as middleware.
